# hdWGCNA-analysis-of-scRNA-seq-data
Generally, WGCNA is performed with bulk RNA seq data. However, the library of hdWGCNA provided a method to analyze gene coexpression from single cells.

This long script describe how to run hdWGCNA after classcial proccedures of scRNA-seq analysis with Seurat

At the same time, explore more of the data, including co-expression profile for the top egigenes, plot of network with igraph.
